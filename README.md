# socketio-experiment
doing some socketio stuff

demo available on http://gerthbrooks.com:3000

some todo ideas
- on player hit, create hit effect from existing shot path
- re-structure messageEL to playerNameEl instead, push to below player
- add actual chat window or something, send messages there instead
- collidable objects in level
- hold mouse down to shoot instead of click

some bigger todo ideas
- change underlying dom base to be canvas instead
- particles
- level art
- layered levels, hide under canopy-type layers. under roof / treetop / some kind of grating pattern
